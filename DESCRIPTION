Author: Nate Apathy
Maintainer: Nate Apathy <nate.apathy@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions that make it easy to query the PatentsView API by CPC.
    The main function, patents_view(cpc="CPC#"), pulls a fixed set of fields for patents with a given CPC.
    Patents are only pulled if they have an application date after or on January 1, 2000.
    Patents are only pulled if the applicant is US-based.
    The function creates a flat file of patent information including:
    Patent number, title, abstract, granted date, inventor and assignee information, and other CPCs assigned
